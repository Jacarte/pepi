# Pepi evaluations

The SWE-bench integration uses a separate frozen local-only profile. It never
changes your live Pi settings. Run commands from the Pepi repository root.

- [Prepare, build and run](swebench/README.md): task containers and predictions.
- [Telemetry](swebench/TELEMETRY.md): time, turns, parent/child tokens and cost.
- [Grade and compare](swebench/REPORTING.md): official results plus JSON/CSV/Markdown reports.

Each configuration change needs fresh generation, not just regrading old patches.
Use a dedicated gateway key, externally restricted networking and fixed budgets.
Do not commit run directories, credentials, benchmark answer patches or transcripts.

Offline checks:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s evals/swebench/tests -v
node --test evals/swebench/tests/telemetry-extension.test.mjs
```

The stack is intentionally ready for review, not a claim of a measured Pepi score:
a one-task Docker/gateway smoke run is still required on your target setup.
